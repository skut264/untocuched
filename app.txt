obtusing our way toward each other's denouement
sending up flares to announce our happiness, And when the eyes of the onlooker burned,

that we built
now I ask you: how will you manage? without the steadiness of our long unhappiness

CHAPTER 3
It was half past 9 and David tried to sleep in his bed. He shut his eyes hard and tried to drift away into the realm of dreams leaving the painful reality behind .But something kept pulling him. He sat up broken without knowing what to do. Like a boon from the god, his mother called him. Over joyed he cried on hearing her voice and his masculine voice turned into a fog of whisper, whispering “ma! I miss you!, please come and save your little child.”
Upset over hearing her son cry, she asked “what is it that’s bothering my baby?? Did someone bully you at work??”

“No ma!...” cried David as heated tears roll down his cheeks. “Terrible things are happening to me ma! “
“Don’t worry baby! It’s going to be fine. Come over to my place” said his mom, trying to reassure him.
Hearing those words, he kissed her and he immediately sprang out of the bed, throwing the phone and locking the door behind him.
“Don’t forget your umbrella shouted his mom” But he was long gone.
Usually it was a 2 hr drive from his home, to his moms’ place. But today it took longer than usual. There was no public transport as rain clogged each nuke end corner of the city. He walked half of the distance, hitch -hiking at times and by the time he reached his mom’s place, it was past midnight.
On seeing him, his mother extended her arms and cried “oh my boy! You’re all wet and looking pale! What’s happening to you my boy??”
Hugging her hard, feeling her warmth He finally felt secure.
“Don’t worry my boy! I’m there with you” assured his mom, combing his wet hair.
“I too wish the same ma. I too wish you were here with me now” cried David as he hugged her headstone in the water filled Cemetery @ Kilpauk.

1/21/22, 10:32 PM - Patrick Jane: This is my most fav n complete chapter
1/21/22, 10:59 PM - Patrick Jane: I lay on the bed, with my eyes fixed to the ceiling. The slow whirring sound of the air conditioner filled the room. I needed silence so I turned it off. I try to fix my attention on the ceiling again but the moon keeked through the transparent window right at my face. Irritated I got up from the bed and showed my middle finger @ the moon and drew the curtains over the window. I dug my face in the bed and tried hard to level my thoughts. My mind was wavering.
 Slowly my mind calmed down and my muscles relaxed. But all of a sudden an owl sitting on some twig of a tree started hooting loudly. Even through the closed window I could hear it so distinctly. I covered my ears with my pillows so hard till it hurts but as I pressed harder the owl hooted even more loudly. Even more irritated now, I wrapped myself with the blanket and mummified myself. For about 15 minutes the owl hooted at its peak voice. Then slowly the owl stopped hooting. Relieved I slowly unwrapped myself and inhaled a one big mouthful of air and I let it pass down through my oesophogous into my stomach, swirling their way from small intestine to large intestine and out away. I oxygenated my blood. To my left was a digital clock hanging on the wall. What caught my attention was the time was still and seconds refused to proceed further into the future. The clock stopped at 12:07am.
It was the 3rd time in the week the clock stopped working. Thinking what could have possibly gone wrong I scratched my head lying in the bed. The room was unusually chill. I had to smother my body with the blanket to prevent the heat from escaping from my body. I Twisted and turned but I could not sleep. 
Slowly I felt and cold wind being blown into my ears. It was so cold that my ear drums frosted. Panicked I jumped up to see my baby little sister blowing in my ear. She had tied her hair in two sided pony tail and was laughing so cutely that instantly my heart melted. She was holding her favorite Barbie doll. My parents said that she had gone to her grandparents’ home. Now that she came back I was so happy. I hugged her so hard transferring all my heat to her. She was as cold as an iceberg. We played all night, singing dancing and I read her stories and by 3:00am she was sound asleep in my lap. I put her on the bed and lied down with her and started to sleep. Even when she was sleeping she clutched her doll so tightly with hand and clasped my thumb with her other hand. I instantly slept. 
Next morning I woke up to see my sister gone. Worried I dressed myself and started out early in the morning @ 6am to see whether my sister had reached her place safely. I walked the empty streets clasping my body with my hands. The fog was so low and freezing that I could hardly see. The fog was slowly turning into droplets of ice and was hitting my face so hard. Wiping it away I walked with steady momentum.      I reached the spot. I was so relieved to find that my sister has reached safely. She was sleeping heavily in her coffin clutching her favorite doll. The same doll that we buried with her when she died. What was more terrifying?? The fact that I realized that the clock in my home stopped working  everyday exactly at the time when my sister breathed her last breath or the fact that even after 5 years my parents still visit my grave with a blue face to pay homage. The grave I specially asked for next to my sisters’??
1/22/22, 10:49 AM - Nivedha NV: Ithu thaan first 2 va?
1/22/22, 10:51 AM - Nivedha NV: Oh my goodness. It went real dark real quick
1/22/22, 10:55 AM - Nivedha NV: Oh my goodness.
1/22/22, 10:55 AM - Nivedha NV: The writing is really good. Conveyed the mood and feel of the scene really well.
1/22/22, 10:55 AM - Nivedha NV: I could visualise the writing so very well.
1/22/22, 10:56 AM - Nivedha NV: I have doubts buddy... 
So I assume the person is dead. Then how come he got a room, clock or window in a grave?
1/22/22, 10:58 AM - Nivedha NV: And again... How come he can see inside the coffin. As far as I understand, you can't open coffin againlaam
1/22/22, 11:00 AM - Nivedha NV: Questions:
How come his mother called from tombstone?
Is it like a dream because he missed his mother or imagination? Or his mother's soul?
1/22/22, 11:37 AM - Patrick Jane: no no, ithu oru shortie that i wrote
1/22/22, 11:40 AM - Nivedha NV: Yeah. Gotch
1/22/22, 11:42 AM - Patrick Jane: how i perceived it na,  the boy had a little sis, who dies, then the boy is diagnosed to be sick n ll die soo, so he asks a place next to his sis, and how they say when the  earthly ties are not severed properly, the dead returns to the mortal world, the dead boy likewise, returns to his room , that's where he sleeps in his bed, that's where his sis comes, 

dead can see the dead, that's how the boy sees his sis sleeping in the coffin🥲
1/22/22, 11:43 AM - Patrick Jane: didnt want to put all the info out there but rather let it to the imagination of the reader
1/22/22, 11:48 AM - Patrick Jane: this is actually a continuation of a part of a story, the character here is actually going thru a lot of depression. just to emphasize that and the core reason for his depression(his mother's untimely departure) the chapter starts by showing  he actually living the moment but at the end, it is subtly conveyed that the depression has caused him to imagine(like u said)
1/22/22, 11:53 AM - Patrick Jane: my most fav piece of writing till date 🥲
1/22/22, 11:53 AM - Patrick Jane: 👌🏻✨🪴
1/22/22, 4:15 PM - Nivedha NV: Oh.. gotcha
1/22/22, 4:16 PM - Nivedha NV: I mean... I understand the better left to imagination part. It's good
1/22/22, 4:16 PM - Nivedha NV: But this piece can be structured in such a way to kindle the imagination. It kinda probed me to questioning here.
1/22/22, 4:17 PM - Nivedha NV: Maybe.. leave bit of a clue or a back story.. not everything
1/22/22, 4:17 PM - Nivedha NV: Tiny bit
1/22/22, 4:18 PM - Nivedha NV: It's good buddy. The writing is cool. The story line went dark real cook, but I felt the emotion
1/22/22, 4:18 PM - Nivedha NV: Depression to imagine mother ah... So the piece is not done yet if I presume. There is story left, right?
1/22/22, 4:26 PM - Patrick Jane: Yea yea
1/22/22, 4:28 PM - Patrick Jane: Oh, any example that u can
1/22/22, 4:29 PM - Patrick Jane: Okayyyy🪴
1/22/22, 4:30 PM - Patrick Jane: Understood 🌟
1/22/22, 4:39 PM - Nivedha NV: Maybe when he is seeing the ceiling or when he gets annoyed seeing the clock stuck at 12:07, he actually remembers a movie that resonates dead coming back to the mortal realm or something like that... (Left for you to fill)
1/22/22, 4:40 PM - Nivedha NV: Leave a bit of a clue in the mid-while... Anything which will get tied up in the end
1/22/22, 5:28 PM - Patrick Jane: 😍👌👌👌👌

8/22/22, 11:26 PM - Nivedha NV: a) A new contact will be created irrespective of the existing contact in Freshdesk
b) Existing contact will be merged together
8/22/22, 11:28 PM - Nivedha NV: When two contacts have the same number and the customer reaches out in chat, which contact the chat gets associated to?
Answer : The most recently added contact with that number
8/22/22, 11:30 PM - Nivedha NV: In the recently introduced BYOT like five9, do the customers who call, get added to the UCR?
Yes. The BYOT is built in such a way
8/22/22, 11:32 PM - Nivedha NV: After UCR, can Freshchat still store and edit contacts  or is it to be done from Freshdesk?

Ans: The people tab is still functional to store anonymous users and contacts. But the contacts cannot be edited
8/22/22, 11:34 PM - Nivedha NV: What happened to the custom properties in the freshchat that can be added by the agent after the advent of UCR?

Or 

Can agents from freshchat still add custom properties as they used to?

Ans: 
No, custom properties for agents have been discarded since everything contact field is modified in the freshdesk
8/22/22, 11:34 PM - Patrick Jane: Answer?
8/22/22, 11:35 PM - Nivedha NV: Existing contact will be merged
8/22/22, 11:35 PM - Nivedha NV: But I don't know how it behaves if whatsapp number is the other number and not the primary

8/23/22, 9:34 AM - Nivedha NV: Another question:

Ans: Yes
8/23/22, 9:36 AM - Nivedha NV: Together we are strongER!
8/23/22, 10:35 AM - Nivedha NV: Do conversation properties have to be created from Freshchat?

8/23/22, 11:07 AM - Nivedha NV: Can UCR be applicable when a Freshdesk standalone be bundled together with freshchat and freshcaller?
8/23/22, 11:08 AM - Nivedha NV: Ans : No

11/21/22, 11:06 PM - Patrick Jane: The moment I tasted your tea 🍵... I was drowned in an euphoric feeling 🌀.. I had the chance to taste few of your finely made (20 mins) tea 🍵.. Out of all.. This tea tasted so luscious.. Strangely, I felt like the tea had right blend of sugar, tea powder, milk and adequate amount of love when the tea 🍵 was made ✨
11/21/22, 11:10 PM - Patrick Jane: For once in my life , only this time,  being a malayali, I felt a strange feeling of breaking up with coffee ☕ and starting a life lasting relationship with tea 🍵.. Only if I had the person who made this euphoric tea with me, to make this tea 🍵 for me every single day..

 Imagining myself starting my day with this  richly made tea gave me multiple sets of goosebumps in quick succession 😻
11/21/22, 11:12 PM - Patrick Jane: Never rehearsed any of what's mentioned... Just threw it right from my cold ❄ heart.. Wanted to keep it within me, since there was high chance for you to push this away as overly powdered compliment.. But since u asked today before leaving.. I wanted to open the gateway to my heart n say it out nervethless

1/8/23, 10:59 AM - Patrick Jane: This is true for every relationship. Take parents for example, they always expect big things from us and we end up disappointing them. And in reality we do our best while we are left in pain. A friend who understands you still unconsciously sets some expectation and reality stinks up the place because of smallest of things between them. 

But the irony here, us settling for what it is and keep at it without seeing it through is where we all go wrong. Mostly and at least in India some other similar cultures, no matter what, we don’t leave our parents for such reasons. While we are nowadays ready to break up with a friend or a beloved for the smallest of things!

1/30/23, 11:21 PM - Nivedha NV: I just went through my shelf and got myself looking at the gifts that you gave. As much as it pains to say this, I would really like to return them.
1/30/23, 11:25 PM - Patrick Jane: I would request you to keep it with you.. If you don't want to, kindly find a way to keep it off your view . As much as it pains to say this, I would really wish you not do all this, putting both of us in so much pain.
1/30/23, 11:29 PM - Patrick Jane: The love that we had is so true, I really hope we can introspect what Happened. Nobody's right or wrong. But I really wish you could see thru me, putting down your anger at least once

What I did is wrong, but for that you really can't say our entire bond was fake. I would really appreciate if you refrain from saying that our whole bond was a fake one.  Mistakes yes, unreal or fake, no.

Thanks
2/1/23, 10:14 AM - Nivedha NV: I didn't call it over one incident. But it is fake ma

2/16/23, 12:22 AM - Nivedha NV: Well.. I don't understand
2/16/23, 12:23 AM - Nivedha NV: Anyways... I have said everything that I wanted to say to you.
2/16/23, 12:24 AM - Nivedha NV: It's with you to decide.
2/16/23, 12:24 AM - Nivedha NV: Night!
2/16/23, 12:24 AM - Patrick Jane: i wish u actually meant this
2/16/23, 12:29 AM - Patrick Jane: first ethuku eduhtlaum contact reomve parnatha niruthu
2/16/23, 12:33 AM - Patrick Jane: . i have decided
2/16/23, 12:33 AM - Patrick Jane: Night!
2/17/23, 10:21 PM - Patrick Jane: When u said to Nik today you will be going home, it kinda felt really heavy inside..  anyways u ll ignore this msg like u ignored me today or throw some venom on me over text.. Anyways.. ill miss you
2/18/23, 10:07 PM - Patrick Jane: I was thinking about what you saix
2/18/23, 10:07 PM - Patrick Jane: *said
2/18/23, 10:08 PM - Patrick Jane: Probably you may be right.. It's better to look at someone as a friend than as a subject.. It makes life lot easier for myself n everyone around me
2/18/23, 10:10 PM - Patrick Jane: I saw how you both were getting along. It was good to see you both together.
2/18/23, 10:11 PM - Patrick Jane: Maybe if one person stops looking at someone as a subject n look at people as mere friend it may make the other one comfortable n happy
2/18/23, 10:11 PM - Patrick Jane: So I guess I'll do what you asked me to
2/18/23, 10:12 PM - Patrick Jane: No more instances, just you, me, our  friends
2/18/23, 10:13 PM - Patrick Jane: I just want everyone around me to be happy.
2/18/23, 10:14 PM - Patrick Jane: Despite everything that happened, I noticed ppl still care for me, be it caring from a distant or thinking about me when they want to do something.
2/18/23, 10:15 PM - Patrick Jane: I decided to cheirsh such bonds, being normal with ppl around me is something I'm looking forward to do. Scary yet looking forward to it
2/18/23, 10:15 PM - Patrick Jane: New beginnings indeed ✨
2/18/23, 10:17 PM - Patrick Jane: Thank you, initially it really hurt me when I heard those words from yu.. It make senses. Probably I have an identity beyond my books, notes, experiments
2/18/23, 10:17 PM - Patrick Jane: I'm looking forward to find it ✨ 🍃
2/18/23, 10:48 PM - Nivedha NV: I am happy about it.
2/18/23, 10:48 PM - Nivedha NV: It's not gonna be you me though.
2/18/23, 10:48 PM - Nivedha NV: It's going to be your new found friends and you
2/18/23, 10:49 PM - Nivedha NV: But I am glad that you decided to probably turn things around or atleast saying you will.
2/18/23, 10:54 PM - Patrick Jane: It's you me da kanna,
2/18/23, 10:54 PM - Patrick Jane: No da ma, I also want you to be with me. My first close best friend, aporm than yellarum uhm
2/18/23, 10:54 PM - Patrick Jane: I'm anxious but looking forward to see how things will be
2/18/23, 10:55 PM - Patrick Jane: I decided to take this leap, just for you, just because my frnd felt hurt and still wants to be with me,
2/18/23, 10:56 PM - Nivedha NV: Just stop.
2/18/23, 10:56 PM - Patrick Jane: Now when I'm convincing myself to do it nee idpi lam solra
2/18/23, 10:56 PM - Nivedha NV: Enough with the lies again
2/18/23, 10:56 PM - Nivedha NV: I am long gone from your friendship pedestal
2/18/23, 10:56 PM - Patrick Jane: If it's long gone I wouldn't be here now
2/18/23, 10:56 PM - Patrick Jane: Understand that
2/18/23, 10:56 PM - Nivedha NV: But I respect you as a colleague from now on
2/18/23, 10:56 PM - Nivedha NV: I am sorry Sathish. I am really in no mood or wish to argue with you
2/18/23, 10:57 PM - Patrick Jane: Spew venom as much as you want
2/18/23, 10:57 PM - Patrick Jane: I'm not here to argue
2/18/23, 10:57 PM - Patrick Jane: I'm here to let you know
2/18/23, 10:57 PM - Patrick Jane: That I'm going to do what you asked me to
2/18/23, 10:57 PM - Nivedha NV: I just wanted to congratulate you for something that you found.
2/18/23, 10:57 PM - Patrick Jane: Ur choice
2/18/23, 10:57 PM - Nivedha NV: But I realised you can't ever be my close friend anymore because you lost that trust from everything that you have done lately
2/18/23, 10:58 PM - Nivedha NV: I have no intention of doing anything of that sort
2/18/23, 10:58 PM - Patrick Jane: I made my decision n I'm here to let you know
2/18/23, 10:58 PM - Patrick Jane: Lately? Before it was previous incidents, now it's lately
2/18/23, 10:58 PM - Nivedha NV: Thank you. I appreciate you saying that.
2/18/23, 10:58 PM - Nivedha NV: Both means the same FYI
2/18/23, 10:59 PM - Patrick Jane: New beginnings, starting small, might work, don't put any imaginative trust on me. You don't have to, I mean you won't, let's start simple
2/18/23, 11:00 PM - Nivedha NV: Sorry to say this. There is nothing to start with you.
2/18/23, 11:00 PM - Nivedha NV: Since you had a mindset change, I would like you to know a few somethings.
2/18/23, 11:00 PM - Nivedha NV: I genuinely can't trust people and you knew that already before you did anything.
2/18/23, 11:01 PM - Nivedha NV: You did treat me as a subject and that never changed.
2/18/23, 11:01 PM - Nivedha NV: And the thing that was creepy was you did the exact same thing with sripratha. For the better or for the worse, I don't want nobody to be treated as subjects. I respect people around me that much.
2/18/23, 11:02 PM - Nivedha NV: Paavam she didn't even know that you treated her as a subject until now.
2/18/23, 11:02 PM - Nivedha NV: Anyways...
2/18/23, 11:03 PM - Nivedha NV: Apart from that,

The thing that you pulled on the Christmas something day. I don't think I can forgive you for that. I can forget it bu the lesson learnt will always stay with me
2/18/23, 11:03 PM - Patrick Jane: You deleted this message
2/18/23, 11:03 PM - Patrick Jane: Yes,
2/18/23, 11:04 PM - Nivedha NV: If you badly wanted her to give you a gift or for you to give her a gift... You could have done it and not included me in anything
2/18/23, 11:04 PM - Patrick Jane: You deleted this message
2/18/23, 11:05 PM - Nivedha NV: The audacity of you saying... "I did this because of you" as if I am gonna get jealous is insane. But you still said it. And you took it to the next level by writing a chit?

Wow... Thinking about it is making me furious.
2/18/23, 11:05 PM - Nivedha NV: The lies that surrounded it. Pppaa...
2/18/23, 11:05 PM - Nivedha NV: Can't
2/18/23, 11:06 PM - Nivedha NV: You are just saying that she is your friend because you started liking her, and I have a firm belief that if she was not upto your expectations, you would have gladly moved on to the next person. Am I right or not?
2/18/23, 11:06 PM - Patrick Jane: I'm glad you finally decided to speak things out, please go ahead I'll answer all your queries once you are done
2/18/23, 11:07 PM - Nivedha NV: I am not speaking things out. No amount of justification you give will turn things around.
2/18/23, 11:08 PM - Nivedha NV: I am bidding good bye to you. But I am not a bad person.
2/18/23, 11:08 PM - Nivedha NV: Infact, the lose is yours Sathish.
2/18/23, 11:10 PM - Nivedha NV: Anyways... All the best with your life and everything that holds.
2/18/23, 11:10 PM - Patrick Jane: I'm not justifying my actions, I know I can't justify.
2/18/23, 11:11 PM - Nivedha NV: I wish you the best. Hope when you make connections, you don't spoil them with lies.
2/18/23, 11:11 PM - Patrick Jane: Before you leave
2/18/23, 11:11 PM - Patrick Jane: Pls read my replies
2/18/23, 11:11 PM - Patrick Jane: You don't need to reply if you don't feel like
2/18/23, 11:11 PM - Patrick Jane: Just read them at least
2/18/23, 11:12 PM - Patrick Jane: Yes, but once you became my friend I stopped treating you that way, and even confessed this and told you I no longer saw you as "subject" but just as my only close friend at office
2/18/23, 11:13 PM - Nivedha NV: Please stop with only close friend. Friends empower each other. Don't move on when they fire subjects.
2/18/23, 11:13 PM - Patrick Jane: I confessed this to you as well she's my subject, till last Friday and even said no when you asked me to stop treating her n others as subject. But now if my stubbornness will make me lose you, especially after u decided to come back n start again, n then snapped back again, I wondered what am I doing
2/18/23, 11:14 PM - Patrick Jane: Allow me to finish pls
2/18/23, 11:15 PM - Patrick Jane: Yes my biggest mistake, my biggest experimental failure which caused lot of loss, especially yu.. Maybe I should have informed u better is waht I regret to the very day rather saying "don't react no matter what happens on Thursday" I know it'll be a tainted scar on my name in ur head
2/18/23, 11:15 PM - Patrick Jane: I'll add this to my lifetime regrets list
2/18/23, 11:16 PM - Patrick Jane: Seri maybe I didn't construct my words properly. For someone who thrives on word, I lost my ability to frame my sentences when it comes to expressing myself to my close friend. Another mistake
2/18/23, 11:17 PM - Patrick Jane: But all I cN tell you is, it's 👆🏻 not what I actually wanted to convey or WHT I wanted u to understand
2/18/23, 11:18 PM - Patrick Jane: Saying anything more wi not make things better but only worse, so I will accept it as my mind failure to express things properly
2/18/23, 11:19 PM - Nivedha NV: Don't deviate from that. You either meant it or said it as a cover up.
2/18/23, 11:19 PM - Patrick Jane: I'm not deviating ma.. I vividly remember every word I said on that firday night
2/18/23, 11:20 PM - Patrick Jane: But I said those words with different intention n meaning, but it turned out to be something else. Jealousy, mutinity nu enanamo establish aidchu
2/18/23, 11:20 PM - Patrick Jane: Shit
2/18/23, 11:22 PM - Patrick Jane: Started liking her? Hahaha. As a subject, it was not below my expectations, so that's why I said no to you when u asked me to stop. But moving away this "while subject" is something I decided after those long talks with u
2/18/23, 11:23 PM - Patrick Jane: Maybe I shouldn't do it, even if the person doesn't know.. My frnd knows it n it affects her,
2/18/23, 11:23 PM - Patrick Jane: Plus nee sona Mari than, u care for the ppl around u
2/18/23, 11:24 PM - Patrick Jane: I'm sure you don't anyone doing anything with them. Athan Iwas thinking.. All these while, all my ranting about me being ur goooood friend was true at least to the slightest extent then I should make sure I don't do anything to my frnd or to my frnds frnd
2/18/23, 11:25 PM - Patrick Jane: I noticed this so strongly yesterday when you were having multiple conversations with her..
2/18/23, 11:26 PM - Nivedha NV: You still did not answer why you did that in the first place? Don't cover it up with what got establishedlaaam
2/18/23, 11:26 PM - Patrick Jane: Varan da iru
2/18/23, 11:27 PM - Patrick Jane: Ur words with her were geniune n real, maybe u r right..
2/18/23, 11:27 PM - Nivedha NV: sorry? You noticed that yesterday after all these time you have known me?
2/18/23, 11:27 PM - Nivedha NV: wow!!!! when was I ever not genuine with people around me.
2/18/23, 11:28 PM - Patrick Jane: I meant noticed it so intensely, especially when it was just 3 of us around and no one else. I saw it so vividly
2/18/23, 11:28 PM - Patrick Jane: I never said this da.
2/18/23, 11:28 PM - Patrick Jane: I meant this
2/18/23, 11:28 PM - Patrick Jane: Not this
2/18/23, 11:29 PM - Patrick Jane: I really wished after seeing ur both conversations n with nikil
2/18/23, 11:29 PM - Patrick Jane: I really wanted to have such normal conversations
2/18/23, 11:29 PM - Patrick Jane: Minus all the mentalist stuff
2/18/23, 11:30 PM - Patrick Jane: That's why I decided to pull the plug on things at office da ma
2/18/23, 11:30 PM - Patrick Jane: To be brutally honest with you
2/18/23, 11:30 PM - Patrick Jane: Judge me for my answer but I don't care
2/18/23, 11:33 PM - Patrick Jane: I was desperate because my so called "orchestrated play" failed miserably and it really pressed the wrong buttons inside my frnds head. And my words failed me back to back.. I knew I was losing you, with each passing day after Christmas
2/18/23, 11:33 PM - Patrick Jane: And I never in fact rehearsed my words before I uttered them to u
2/18/23, 11:34 PM - Patrick Jane: Just one thought - I should not lose you
2/18/23, 11:34 PM - Nivedha NV: Nope. You didn't say what was the motive behind that play in the first place
2/18/23, 11:34 PM - Patrick Jane: It was an experiment da ma I told u that
2/18/23, 11:34 PM - Nivedha NV: That does not fly now
2/18/23, 11:34 PM - Nivedha NV: Sorry.... Why ?
2/18/23, 11:35 PM - Nivedha NV: That is anyways, long gone now
2/18/23, 11:40 PM - Patrick Jane: Like I said I was running experiments on subjects, multiple ppl, like hussam, garima
2/18/23, 11:40 PM - Nivedha NV: No
2/18/23, 11:40 PM - Nivedha NV: Wow
2/18/23, 11:40 PM - Nivedha NV: Still going with this
2/18/23, 11:40 PM - Nivedha NV: Nope
2/18/23, 11:41 PM - Patrick Jane: Not any more
2/18/23, 11:41 PM - Patrick Jane: The chrismom Chris Child was like my biggest stage play
2/18/23, 11:41 PM - Patrick Jane: Failed one yes
2/18/23, 11:42 PM - Patrick Jane: Remember, do you remember what happened?? The sudden confusion
2/18/23, 11:42 PM - Patrick Jane: That garima Made?
2/18/23, 11:42 PM - Patrick Jane: When Mukesh ws there
2/18/23, 11:42 PM - Patrick Jane: She played spoil sport
2/18/23, 11:42 PM - Patrick Jane: Ruined the whole act
2/18/23, 11:42 PM - Patrick Jane: Do you remember?
2/18/23, 11:43 PM - Nivedha NV: Please just stop referring to people you work with as subjects, first of all. I am not on board with that.
2/18/23, 11:43 PM - Nivedha NV: I don't know
2/18/23, 11:44 PM - Patrick Jane: I've stopped it
2/18/23, 11:44 PM - Nivedha NV: The only thing I can take away from that incident is you pissed me off big time, you wanted to give Sripratha some fancy gifts, and you needed her to gift you as well, had certain people who clash to bless each other and lied to your friend
2/18/23, 11:44 PM - Patrick Jane: I'm explaining myself so I just have to doit like once
2/18/23, 11:47 PM - Nivedha NV: And don't think I am dump as well; there were three people whom you hated that time. It's getting obvious to me now. It's me, niranjan and Karthik so you all of us together
2/18/23, 11:47 PM - Patrick Jane: When she exhausted the number of tries to guess the mom, I asked her to go, but garima insisted it should be revealed n went and hissed my name. And what happened after that was bull shit.
2/18/23, 11:48 PM - Patrick Jane: Take away-I wanted sheeba to believe I was her mom and my subject to believe her mom was not at office

U got pissed not because I gifted but i lied to you about the whole incident
2/18/23, 11:48 PM - Patrick Jane: I would never hate u r karthik.. Maybe niranjan yes but not u two
2/18/23, 11:48 PM - Patrick Jane: U can say all u want to think
2/18/23, 11:48 PM - Patrick Jane: But I know that I would never hate u both
2/18/23, 11:49 PM - Patrick Jane: He was there with u when I couldn't.. That sole reason is enuf for me to have lifetime respect n love for him
2/18/23, 11:49 PM - Patrick Jane: He is like my little brother
2/18/23, 11:49 PM - Nivedha NV: That is not the take away at all.
2/18/23, 11:49 PM - Patrick Jane: Don't u dare pull him into this mess
2/18/23, 11:49 PM - Patrick Jane: And make it look like I pulled shit against him da ma
2/18/23, 11:50 PM - Patrick Jane: U need to calm down
2/18/23, 11:50 PM - Patrick Jane: First
2/18/23, 11:50 PM - Patrick Jane: That's the true take away. Only if garima didn't ruin things, everything would have been fine
2/18/23, 11:52 PM - Patrick Jane: My biggest failure, yes the stage act, n my dunce level lying to u
2/18/23, 11:52 PM - Patrick Jane: Now I feel super blank not thinking about anything that I normally think about
2/18/23, 11:52 PM - Patrick Jane: How will I make human connections. I don't know at all 😂
2/18/23, 11:53 PM - Patrick Jane: But if my distant LA nikra frnd wants me to do that.. At least this I can do "truly"
2/18/23, 11:53 PM - Patrick Jane: Papom da ma
2/18/23, 11:55 PM - Patrick Jane: Oruthanga kooda ilathathukum.. Oruthanga koodave irunthum ilathamari irukrathukum.. Romba vidhiasam iruku..
2/18/23, 11:56 PM - Patrick Jane: Intha vali lenthu than Nan valka full aah odran. I don't want to feel this again.
2/18/23, 11:59 PM - Nivedha NV: Anyways.
2/18/23, 11:59 PM - Nivedha NV: I think talking to you leads no where
2/18/23, 11:59 PM - Nivedha NV: All the best for making genuined connections.
2/19/23, 12:00 AM - Nivedha NV: Don't try to manipulate people into liking you, one day or other, all of which will come to light.
2/19/23, 12:00 AM - Nivedha NV: and all that you did will go to waste.
2/19/23, 12:00 AM - Nivedha NV: try to be genuine with atleast people who care for you
2/19/23, 12:01 AM - Nivedha NV: And for your information, i took back the picture with the red door. I am not comfortable with you picturising one small thing i said to you in confidence
2/19/23, 12:02 AM - Nivedha NV: Thank god you don't know anything about me actually. I can't imagine those being picturized
2/19/23, 12:13 AM - Patrick Jane: All these time I believed you would understand me, looks like you don't want to understand
2/19/23, 12:13 AM - Nivedha NV: Think of whatever da.
2/19/23, 12:14 AM - Nivedha NV: Even If i understand things, it doesn't mean that these things didn't happen
2/19/23, 12:14 AM - Patrick Jane: That's my only memory of you
2/19/23, 12:15 AM - Nivedha NV: And genuinely, I cant' ever think of you as any thing more than a colleague now.
2/19/23, 12:16 AM - Nivedha NV: Honestly speaking, you know you don't deserve it
2/19/23, 12:21 AM - Nivedha NV: One thing that got solidified in all my interactions with you is never trust people. I didn't have much trust in people in the first place da, but thank you for making me believe that it's the right decision.
2/19/23, 12:21 AM - Nivedha NV: I know these are such terrible words and I don't want to deliberately hurt you, but you should know what you did to me.
2/19/23, 12:21 AM - Nivedha NV: And this is what it is.
2/19/23, 1:00 AM - Patrick Jane: On this day of mahashivaratri I realized something
2/19/23, 1:01 AM - Patrick Jane: It's not that you don't understand me or my words
2/19/23, 1:01 AM - Patrick Jane: It's just that you don't want to understand nor accept
2/19/23, 1:01 AM - Nivedha NV: Mahashivratri is bringing all of us a lot of realisations.
2/19/23, 1:03 AM - Patrick Jane: It's that you don't want to see thru ur emotions and see ur frnds
2/19/23, 1:03 AM - Patrick Jane: Yu just want to put it out that you r always right
2/19/23, 1:03 AM - Nivedha NV: Great da
2/19/23, 1:03 AM - Nivedha NV: If that's what you think, it's even better
2/19/23, 1:04 AM - Patrick Jane: Despite ur frnd accepting all his mistakes u still treat him like our interactions from the beginning was absolute waste of time and then
2/19/23, 1:04 AM - Patrick Jane: Say alll such words
2/19/23, 1:04 AM - Nivedha NV: Just confirms whatever i said.
2/19/23, 1:04 AM - Patrick Jane: If this is what u  wanted go ahead
2/19/23, 1:04 AM - Nivedha NV: It started on a fake note
2/19/23, 1:05 AM - Patrick Jane: I'm tired of explaining, I'm tired of everything daa, I' hate everyone, people relationship, everything is unreal n so fake
2/19/23, 1:05 AM - Nivedha NV: The very fact that I am still listening to you and want you to be making friends should help you understand that I do care for you in one corner of my heart
2/19/23, 1:05 AM - Patrick Jane: How can anyone just chuck away a special bond just like that
2/19/23, 1:05 AM - Patrick Jane: N say  all these
2/19/23, 1:06 AM - Nivedha NV: I could have directly gone to the concerned person and finished this once and for all
2/19/23, 1:06 AM - Nivedha NV: Can't I?
2/19/23, 1:06 AM - Patrick Jane: Right I  go around breaking ppl.. That's what u want to hear frm me right?
2/19/23, 1:06 AM - Patrick Jane: Yes I hate everyone who's happy
2/19/23, 1:06 AM - Patrick Jane: I' break them
2/19/23, 1:06 AM - Patrick Jane: I want to destroy tum
2/19/23, 1:06 AM - Patrick Jane: *them
2/19/23, 1:06 AM - Patrick Jane: I see everyone as subjects
2/19/23, 1:06 AM - Patrick Jane: I don't have real friends
2/19/23, 1:06 AM - Nivedha NV: I guess you don't want to. You don't have to explain.
2/19/23, 1:06 AM - Patrick Jane: Becoz I don't believe there such a thing exists
2/19/23, 1:07 AM - Patrick Jane: I see people as just flesh n nothing more

2/19/23, 1:09 AM - Patrick Jane: Maybe that's why my dad ditchede
2/19/23, 1:09 AM - Nivedha NV: Wait.  Before you go over board... 
I knew you were trying to manipulate me from the beginning and I knew I was your subject.
2/19/23, 1:09 AM - Patrick Jane: Everyone is my subwjxt
2/19/23, 1:09 AM - Patrick Jane: I go around doing this
2/19/23, 1:09 AM - Patrick Jane: From cab driver to nikil to bahart
2/19/23, 1:09 AM - Patrick Jane: Everyone is my subwjxt
2/19/23, 1:09 AM - Patrick Jane: I don't have any real or meaningful conversation with anyone
2/19/23, 1:10 AM - Patrick Jane: My conversation with karthik is all fake
2/19/23, 1:10 AM - Nivedha NV: But I didn't stop being friends with you. 
I know when I had to when you plan elaborate lies and tells me with confidence
2/19/23, 1:10 AM - Patrick Jane: Staged
2/19/23, 1:10 AM - Nivedha NV: The lie that you tell to me about me, I don't believe a single thing and I never used to.
2/19/23, 1:10 AM - Patrick Jane: I just lie thru my tounge telling he's my brother
2/19/23, 1:10 AM - Nivedha NV: The lie that you told about others. Nope. Can't take it
2/19/23, 1:10 AM - Patrick Jane: Such a filthy lie
2/19/23, 1:10 AM - Patrick Jane: Damn I'm so good at telling lies

2/19/23, 1:11 AM - Nivedha NV: And also... I had empathy and thought maybe we are similar in what we go through
2/19/23, 1:11 AM - Patrick Jane: Maybe that's why I'mober shit
2/19/23, 1:11 AM - Nivedha NV: I don't know what I wanted to hear. But not this
2/19/23, 1:11 AM - Patrick Jane: No empathy needed I come from a dystopian family
2/19/23, 1:12 AM - Patrick Jane: Twisted dad, who left me,  mother with failed parenting statergy
2/19/23, 1:12 AM - Patrick Jane: Here I'm a by product of her failure
2/19/23, 1:12 AM - Nivedha NV: That's why you need that empathy
2/19/23, 1:12 AM - Patrick Jane: Ruining ppl's life
2/19/23, 1:12 AM - Patrick Jane: This is waht u ve been saying lately to me
2/19/23, 1:13 AM - Patrick Jane: Maybe this is what I'm
2/19/23, 1:13 AM - Patrick Jane: Maybe I enjoy seeing others in pain
2/19/23, 1:13 AM - Patrick Jane: Maybe that's why I can't lead a normal life
2/19/23, 1:13 AM - Nivedha NV: Just pause
2/19/23, 1:13 AM - Nivedha NV: Take a deep breath
2/19/23, 1:13 AM - Nivedha NV: Pause again

2/19/23, 1:14 AM - Patrick Jane: Maybe it's a soveniour
2/19/23, 1:14 AM - Nivedha NV: I didn't say you ruin people's life. You never did that to me and I don't presume you do that to people either.
2/19/23, 1:14 AM - Patrick Jane: Shit does thatt make me a serial killer at heart
2/19/23, 1:14 AM - Patrick Jane: A serial sadist??
2/19/23, 1:15 AM - Patrick Jane: It's good yu took it
2/19/23, 1:15 AM - Nivedha NV: All I am trying to say is, instead of thinking people as subjects, think them as friends who care about you.
2/19/23, 1:15 AM - Patrick Jane: Maybe if u didn't I would hVe gone around collecting more soveniour
2/19/23, 1:15 AM - Patrick Jane: Will I hurt anyone? Physically
2/19/23, 1:15 AM - Patrick Jane: I'm worried
2/19/23, 1:16 AM - Patrick Jane: Maybe I'll stop connecting with ppl
2/19/23, 1:16 AM - Nivedha NV: If I don't emphasize that you hurt me, then you are doomed to repeat the mistake with other people da
2/19/23, 1:16 AM - Patrick Jane: Am I mentally not sane?
2/19/23, 1:16 AM - Patrick Jane: Is that why u told me don't hurt sripratha I'm worried u ll do something to her
2/19/23, 1:16 AM - Nivedha NV: Did I tell that?
2/19/23, 1:17 AM - Patrick Jane: Is that why u flinch at the slightest touch of my hand on urs??
2/19/23, 1:17 AM - Nivedha NV: No da. I did not.

2/19/23, 1:18 AM - Patrick Jane: But I'm not this

2/19/23, 1:18 AM - Nivedha NV: What the hell are you talking about?
2/19/23, 1:18 AM - Patrick Jane: I'ts breaking me so much
2/19/23, 1:19 AM - Patrick Jane: Is this why u moved sooo much away from me
2/19/23, 1:19 AM - Patrick Jane: I promise on I don't know what is special to me.. But on my sane thoughts I never look at anyone with that thought.. I call them subject just for name sake
2/19/23, 1:19 AM - Nivedha NV: I do that with any of friends when I am in a fight. If you want to take it upon yourself , please do. But it's a me problem. Ask Karthik how many times I did that when we were fighting
2/19/23, 1:19 AM - Patrick Jane: That's all
2/19/23, 1:20 AM - Patrick Jane: Your bond with him is pure and special don't bring that here da ma
2/19/23, 1:20 AM - Patrick Jane: Inga it's just filth
2/19/23, 1:20 AM - Patrick Jane: Sewage
2/19/23, 1:20 AM - Patrick Jane: So sorry
2/19/23, 1:20 AM - Nivedha NV: I wouldn't be even talking to you if that was the case.
2/19/23, 1:21 AM - Patrick Jane: I don't want anyone.. Why do ppl just don't understand me. Is this why I'm sent to this world so that ppl can just misunderstand mee
2/19/23, 1:21 AM - Nivedha NV: Sathish!
2/19/23, 1:21 AM - Nivedha NV: Stop!
2/19/23, 1:21 AM - Nivedha NV: Just stop saying that people don't understand you.
2/19/23, 1:22 AM - Nivedha NV: I did understand you rather I do understand you.
2/19/23, 1:22 AM - Nivedha NV: Are you even trying to understand what I am trying to convey?
2/19/23, 1:22 AM - Nivedha NV: You are taking it way out of proportionssss
2/19/23, 1:23 AM - Nivedha NV: First relax
2/19/23, 1:23 AM - Patrick Jane: I don't know.. My only friend who I thought would understand me without explaining comes one day and says you are making me uncomfortable, u r creepy, don't do anything to her
2/19/23, 1:23 AM - Patrick Jane: I' don't want anyone if this is how ppl are going to look at me
2/19/23, 1:23 AM - Nivedha NV: I didn't say don't do anything to her. I said don't view her as a subject.
2/19/23, 1:23 AM - Nivedha NV: That is completely different
2/19/23, 1:24 AM - Nivedha NV: Sathish... You either don't agree with anything I say or go all in with things I never said.
2/19/23, 1:24 AM - Patrick Jane: Sorry if I had ever made u feel thatt way..
2/19/23, 1:24 AM - Patrick Jane: Maybe I'm not mentally good
2/19/23, 1:24 AM - Patrick Jane: Sorry da maa
2/19/23, 1:24 AM - Patrick Jane: U can ignore me
2/19/23, 1:24 AM - Patrick Jane: Don't waste ur ensgey
2/19/23, 1:25 AM - Nivedha NV: Stop it!
2/19/23, 1:25 AM - Nivedha NV: Like seriously
2/19/23, 1:26 AM - Nivedha NV: I need to talk to you about this. I am not sure if you'll go on about your life saying all this, but I literally can't
2/19/23, 1:27 AM - Patrick Jane: I hope one day u ll understand that my friendship with u was real n geniune.. Even if that day doesn't come.. At least that "hallucating thought" will keep me going.
2/19/23, 1:27 AM - Nivedha NV: You know for how many days I got emotionally overwhelmed and cried for you
2/19/23, 1:27 AM - Nivedha NV: ????
2/19/23, 1:27 AM - Nivedha NV: Like seriously????
2/19/23, 1:27 AM - Patrick Jane: Even u lost hope on me LA
2/19/23, 1:28 AM - Nivedha NV: You wouldn't know. Because your focus was on your subjects
2/19/23, 1:28 AM - Patrick Jane: Nooo, did u? I mean seriously
2/19/23, 1:28 AM - Patrick Jane: Nobody likes me is what ppl tell me
2/19/23, 1:28 AM - Patrick Jane: :( because everyone hates me
2/19/23, 1:29 AM - Patrick Jane: Are u serious daa ma
2/19/23, 1:29 AM - Nivedha NV: Maybe it was real maybe it was not. I was willing to give you a chance even when we got off on the wrong foot. Just because I know your family!
2/19/23, 1:29 AM - Nivedha NV: I have no reason to lie
2/19/23, 1:29 AM - Nivedha NV: Yes. I did that.
2/19/23, 1:29 AM - Patrick Jane: Is that sympathy?
2/19/23, 1:30 AM - Nivedha NV: Sorry? Who is the everyone? You mean niranjan? Preethi? .... What did you do to gain their trust?
2/19/23, 1:30 AM - Nivedha NV: No. It was empathy.
2/19/23, 1:30 AM - Nivedha NV: I thought we would have a connection.
2/19/23, 1:30 AM - Patrick Jane: I know u won't lie at all. But it feels too unreal to even think someone cried for me
2/19/23, 1:30 AM - Nivedha NV: Damn right. Yes.
2/19/23, 1:31 AM - Patrick Jane: They r all bullshit
2/19/23, 1:31 AM - Patrick Jane: Niranjan Preethi stopped talking with me because I got so close to u
2/19/23, 1:31 AM - Nivedha NV: Yeah. You know why don't you?
2/19/23, 1:31 AM - Nivedha NV: Because I was your subject
2/19/23, 1:31 AM - Patrick Jane: Niranjan said this openly, Preethi said this one day
2/19/23, 1:32 AM - Patrick Jane: Because u were my friend
2/19/23, 1:32 AM - Nivedha NV: No.
2/19/23, 1:32 AM - Patrick Jane: Now u r saying they are also right?
2/19/23, 1:32 AM - Nivedha NV: Nobody stops being friends with people just because you are friends with someone
2/19/23, 1:32 AM - Nivedha NV: Do they?
2/19/23, 1:32 AM - Patrick Jane: Yes
2/19/23, 1:32 AM - Patrick Jane: The do
2/19/23, 1:32 AM - Patrick Jane: At least those 2
2/19/23, 1:33 AM - Patrick Jane: *they
2/19/23, 1:33 AM - Nivedha NV: They have no reason to be upset if I am friends with you.
2/19/23, 1:33 AM - Nivedha NV: Again with the lies. Common da
2/19/23, 1:33 AM - Patrick Jane: How many times niranjan mocked me "unaku Ena PA unoda puthu rendu friends karthik nivi irukanga enga kita lam en pesa pora)
2/19/23, 1:34 AM - Nivedha NV: So.. Will you say to sripratha that I stopped being friends with you because you got close with her?
2/19/23, 1:34 AM - Nivedha NV: Common!!!
2/19/23, 1:34 AM - Patrick Jane: Why would I even do that?
2/19/23, 1:34 AM - Nivedha NV: That's exactly what you are doing to niranjan or Preethi
2/19/23, 1:35 AM - Patrick Jane: I don't care about them I tried mending the bond with them.. They didn't budge I showed them the middle finger
2/19/23, 1:35 AM - Nivedha NV: So.. If I say.. unakenna pa... " You have sowrav and sripratha" which I actually did tell. Does that mean I don't like you being friends with them?
2/19/23, 1:35 AM - Nivedha NV: That's bull shit
2/19/23, 1:35 AM - Nivedha NV: I didn't like her as your subject.
2/19/23, 1:35 AM - Patrick Jane: There's a difference between u saying it and him saying it
2/19/23, 1:36 AM - Nivedha NV: Well... Do you remember how you would get very annoyed when anyone else say beside me during lunch?
2/19/23, 1:36 AM - Nivedha NV: Aren't you doing the same to sripratha now?
2/19/23, 1:36 AM - Patrick Jane: I still do
2/19/23, 1:36 AM - Patrick Jane: Noooooo
2/19/23, 1:36 AM - Nivedha NV: At that time I was your subject, now she is!
2/19/23, 1:36 AM - Patrick Jane: This yes
2/19/23, 1:36 AM - Nivedha NV: There is no difference between them and me.
2/19/23, 1:36 AM - Patrick Jane: Ithu noooo
2/19/23, 1:37 AM - Nivedha NV: Please don't lie.
2/19/23, 1:37 AM - Nivedha NV: After all that talk. I would expect honesty from you.
2/19/23, 1:37 AM - Patrick Jane: Do I act weird or annoyed when someone sit next to her?? " if u noticed I always sit opposite to her
2/19/23, 1:37 AM - Patrick Jane: I'm telling u the truth ma
2/19/23, 1:38 AM - Patrick Jane: Even now I get super angry when ppl sit beside u
2/19/23, 1:38 AM - Patrick Jane: At lunch or dinner
2/19/23, 1:38 AM - Nivedha NV: Do you know why I allowed you, not because of the cheesy words you say... But I genuinely knew that I spend a lotta time with people and little with you. And that's why I would sit with you during lunch or dinner.
2/19/23, 1:38 AM - Nivedha NV: Didn't that completely change now? And that's why I was happy you found someone.
2/19/23, 1:38 AM - Patrick Jane: No
2/19/23, 1:38 AM - Nivedha NV: But what triggered me? She was your subject not your friend!!!!
2/19/23, 1:39 AM - Patrick Jane: I still miss you at lunch n dinner, oru naal achum nee pale mariye enkoda Sapda matiyo nu
2/19/23, 1:39 AM - Nivedha NV: Yeah. That was pretty evident from the fact that you wanted her to sit in front of you in office in the old bay and new!
2/19/23, 1:39 AM - Patrick Jane: But please vedha, I'm telling u she's no longer my subject I'm tired of my own word subject
2/19/23, 1:40 AM - Nivedha NV: Good then.
2/19/23, 1:40 AM - Patrick Jane: Yes till last Friday
2/19/23, 1:40 AM - Nivedha NV: This is what I am trying to convey!
2/19/23, 1:40 AM - Nivedha NV: Just have people as friends.
2/19/23, 1:40 AM - Nivedha NV: Only that!
2/19/23, 1:41 AM - Patrick Jane: I'm tired of everything, ppl just drop off, I look around it feels so lonely. So I want to stop everything
2/19/23, 1:41 AM - Patrick Jane: Do yu think I can have friends?
2/19/23, 1:41 AM - Patrick Jane: My best friend eh just left me, how can someone with 0 % knowledge even be my frnd?
2/19/23, 1:42 AM - Nivedha NV: But just like Niranjan or Preethi, even I would have to go la?... That's what I was saying. You don't realise how much you did hurt me in lieu of all your experiments and lying. I deal with that shit enough where I come from. I don't want that from anyone else
2/19/23, 1:43 AM - Nivedha NV: I am not. If you had ever considered me one, you would have never hurt me in any means or way!
2/19/23, 1:43 AM - Patrick Jane: Can u stop brining up their names here. I'm glad  they r gone.. They are so fake.. Glad they left sooner than later
2/19/23, 1:43 AM - Nivedha NV: You would have considered my feelings in everything!
2/19/23, 1:43 AM - Nivedha NV: But you don't
2/19/23, 1:44 AM - Nivedha NV: Just konjam realise that it's also your fault.
2/19/23, 1:44 AM - Patrick Jane: Nanum oru human da, I made a few big mistakes
2/19/23, 1:44 AM - Patrick Jane: Yes I know it's all my fault
2/19/23, 1:44 AM - Patrick Jane: Best way is to not have any connection, loner ah iruntha prwchana ila, 23 years apdi than irunthan, myself n my computer
2/19/23, 1:45 AM - Patrick Jane: If you r going, maybe that's like the last human interaction I'll ever havd
2/19/23, 1:47 AM - Nivedha NV: One other thing that again hurt me a bit is after knowing how much I love working on initiatives you chose to work with your subject at that time. If you had said friend, yes that's different. But subject?. That's when I realised you truly didn't know me. But you know what, I was extremely happy for that but I guess I am that kinda person.
2/19/23, 1:48 AM - Nivedha NV: All I am trying to say is... In future if you truly want people by your side, don't hurt them. Be it sripratha or sowrav or anyone.
2/19/23, 1:48 AM - Patrick Jane: U were never here when this whole thing unfolded daaaa u fell sick apo than
2/19/23, 1:48 AM - Patrick Jane: Fuck all of tbme
2/19/23, 1:48 AM - Patrick Jane: *can't they just die
2/19/23, 1:49 AM - Patrick Jane: Why did they even come to this team
2/19/23, 1:49 AM - Nivedha NV: I really care about people in my team or around me. Anything even slightly fishy for them, I would defend them with anything whether I am close with them or not!
2/19/23, 1:49 AM - Nivedha NV: That's not really the point. Just leave it
2/19/23, 1:50 AM - Nivedha NV: Stop saying that. They care about you.
2/19/23, 1:50 AM - Patrick Jane: I think it's better for u.. Rather than stuck with a nut case like me.. U can have better bond with ppl like karthik who would understand yu better than I did (damn I never thought I will have to say this :'(.  )
2/19/23, 1:50 AM - Patrick Jane: I hate them
2/19/23, 1:51 AM - Nivedha NV: Sathish!
2/19/23, 1:51 AM - Patrick Jane: I'm so feeling if I can do something to get rid of them
2/19/23, 1:51 AM - Patrick Jane: It'll not change anything
2/19/23, 1:51 AM - Patrick Jane: At least it ll give me peace to pacify the longing agony
2/19/23, 1:51 AM - Nivedha NV: I will literally kill you if you said you hate them!
2/19/23, 1:51 AM - Nivedha NV: Sure!
2/19/23, 1:52 AM - Nivedha NV: You think?
2/19/23, 1:52 AM - Patrick Jane: Now I hate everyone
2/19/23, 1:52 AM - Patrick Jane: Nikil bharat, Preethi sowrav ishrath
2/19/23, 1:52 AM - Patrick Jane: Everyone
2/19/23, 1:52 AM - Nivedha NV: You are a nut case. But you know what? Everybody is in one way or the other!
2/19/23, 1:53 AM - Patrick Jane: At least I'll be at peace all by myself. Mudila da kanna
2/19/23, 1:53 AM - Nivedha NV: Don't you think this is a lie?
2/19/23, 1:53 AM - Patrick Jane: I know I'm one.
2/19/23, 1:53 AM - Patrick Jane: If u think it's. A lie pls take it that Way da ma
2/19/23, 1:53 AM - Patrick Jane: I'm lying even now
2/19/23, 1:53 AM - Patrick Jane: Yes it's a lie
2/19/23, 1:53 AM - Patrick Jane: Santhoshama
2/19/23, 1:54 AM - Nivedha NV: Yes. I do think that is because I was there the first day that ever happened
2/19/23, 1:55 AM - Patrick Jane: We 3 were trying some random shit because souwarv aksed if we could do.. Apo antha naai nikil vanthu pathtu Nala iruku neenga 3 perum sethu panunga story build panunga
2/19/23, 1:55 AM - Patrick Jane: Maira panunga nu solitu poitan

2/19/23, 1:55 AM - Patrick Jane: Office ku
2/19/23, 1:55 AM - Patrick Jane: Mudive panitiya
2/19/23, 1:55 AM - Patrick Jane: I speak only lie to u nu?
2/19/23, 1:56 AM - Patrick Jane: Intha Mari lam nee yosikriya
2/19/23, 1:57 AM - Nivedha NV: I think I am conversing with you to somehow make you feel better about me leaving which is toxic in itself. Also I am expecting you to suddenly just leave all your habits which is not really my place to say.
 
I am sorry about that. So sorry. 

I don't want to hurt you anymore with words or get hurt anymore by your actions. If things pan out good with us, let it. 

Otherwise it's better to just go through with it da
2/19/23, 1:58 AM - Nivedha NV: Right. Apdi. Okay then. If you say so da.
2/19/23, 1:58 AM - Nivedha NV: Nothing to be done anymore anyways.
2/19/23, 1:58 AM - Patrick Jane: All this just to say that our bond was toxic all along and u r leaving because u can't handle toxicity
2/19/23, 1:58 AM - Patrick Jane: Okay
2/19/23, 1:58 AM - Patrick Jane: If that makes u feel better
2/19/23, 1:59 AM - Patrick Jane: I'll be a loner
2/19/23, 1:59 AM - Patrick Jane: I won't disturb u with any explanations nor spew my toxicity on u
2/19/23, 1:59 AM - Nivedha NV: You are the only one who can somehow take this completely out of context from what I said.
2/19/23, 2:00 AM - Nivedha NV: Just answer me this please
2/19/23, 2:00 AM - Nivedha NV: Just tell me why I am leaving?
2/19/23, 2:00 AM - Nivedha NV: I wanna understand what you are thinking
2/19/23, 2:01 AM - Patrick Jane: If u don't want to hurt me, why would you keep iterating yu r leaving :') nan Ena kolai ah panitan
2/19/23, 2:01 AM - Patrick Jane: Ena vitu apdiye porathuku
2/19/23, 2:03 AM - Patrick Jane: I've gone beyond the stage where I can think normally
2/19/23, 2:03 AM - Patrick Jane: Don't leave
2/19/23, 2:03 AM - Patrick Jane: There is No problem in this world that can't be fixed
2/19/23, 2:04 AM - Patrick Jane: En solran na, my mom is still with me
2/19/23, 2:04 AM - Patrick Jane: Hahaha
2/19/23, 2:05 AM - Patrick Jane: If she decided to leave me for hurting her trust knowingly or unknowingly, I would have ended up in an orphanage long back
2/19/23, 2:06 AM - Patrick Jane: If at all yu remember, I told you. Yu exhibit lots of characteristics of my mom, my ideal version of my mom that I Al pictured in my head
2/19/23, 2:06 AM - Patrick Jane: This sole thought is what making me spam yu at 2am in the night
2/19/23, 2:07 AM - Patrick Jane: Despite knowing you would come back and say I've left you long back
2/19/23, 2:08 AM - Patrick Jane: I just chucked my habits da.. Your words made me do it, this seems to be by far the longest fight we had, for almost 3 months now
2/19/23, 2:09 AM - Patrick Jane: If you still want to leave me, you can always do.. It's your choice..
2/19/23, 2:10 AM - Patrick Jane: Anyways my OG mom lost all her hope in me, n Now awaits her death, to get relieved from me, every single day she says this
2/19/23, 2:10 AM - Patrick Jane: I guess I'll have another one leaving me in a similar fashion
2/19/23, 2:11 AM - Patrick Jane: I will miss you, I pray to God you don't meet a person like me again in your life
2/19/23, 2:11 AM - Nivedha NV: What the hell?!! You actually said this?
2/19/23, 2:12 AM - Nivedha NV: That is soo sad. Our mom's will never do that
2/19/23, 2:13 AM - Nivedha NV: Sathish... Just calm.
2/19/23, 2:15 AM - Nivedha NV: You need to lose a few to gain a few, innit? Whether I am leaving or not, I hope we both learned something  valuable.
2/19/23, 2:16 AM - Nivedha NV: If you ever thought of me as a true friend, please be reminded that you are a good person and not essentially a bad one.
2/19/23, 2:17 AM - Nivedha NV: That's why I am trying hard to make you understand why you should take care of the people around you and not jump around people.
2/19/23, 2:18 AM - Nivedha NV: Night!
2/22/23, 11:21 PM - Patrick Jane: Shilpi ku nethiki mail anupra sona, she's mailing and asking
2/22/23, 11:22 PM - Patrick Jane: Can u send her the email
2/22/23, 11:22 PM - Patrick Jane: or at least send me the list at least I'll send her if you can't
2/23/23, 4:24 PM - Nivedha NV: Please edit and send. Was not able to properly collate
2/24/23, 10:16 PM - Patrick Jane: Ok
3/10/23, 1:02 AM - Nivedha NV: I know things haven't been great with us, but can I understand why you still have a copy of that red door picture still now?
3/10/23, 6:51 AM - Patrick Jane: Because Im so lonely now. Everyone moved away, from old besties to new frnds. If u had noticed, if u had, I don't talk with ppl the usual way like before. So the only thing that makes me feel comfortable in my place is that picture. Looking at it whenever I feel lonely or angry helps me
3/10/23, 6:53 AM - Patrick Jane: It reminds me of the good times I had with good ppl n how my life was good back at then (ofc life) that's why despite u taking away the picture,  I got myself another one.
3/10/23, 6:53 AM - Patrick Jane: I hope that answers your question
3/10/23, 9:59 AM - Nivedha NV: Just take care of the people like you are doing now, you won't be lonely anymore.
3/10/23, 10:05 AM - Patrick Jane: U know what.. I got what you always wanted for me
3/10/23, 10:07 AM - Patrick Jane: I became the  loneliest now.. Strangely the one who u always call my new found friend has moved away, become distant(I can say, they see me as a colleague only now,) and ppl associated with them also moved steps back.
3/10/23, 10:08 AM - Patrick Jane: I would want to take care of everyone around me. But nobody understands. N I'm accepting this solitude as my gift now. When there's chance to laugh together with tHe "TEAM" I Do, but that's about it
3/10/23, 10:18 AM - Nivedha NV: What I always wanted for you?
3/10/23, 10:18 AM - Nivedha NV: I am not sure about it. Just care about people.
3/10/23, 10:18 AM - Nivedha NV: I don't want you to be lonely
3/10/23, 10:20 AM - Patrick Jane: I will always do that. I will come around rooting for use cases where I can be of little help
3/10/23, 10:20 AM - Patrick Jane: I'm already : ) turns out that's why I'm beginning to spend more time at the table like old times
3/10/23, 10:23 AM - Patrick Jane: solitude so that i understand the value of human connections .
3/10/23, 11:06 AM - Nivedha NV: You were spending time at the foosball table even back then. So does that mean you were lonely then?
3/10/23, 11:07 AM - Nivedha NV: That alone is enough. You'll have your own people soon.
3/10/23, 11:08 AM - Nivedha NV: I didn't want solitude for you. Just have fun with people without turning that into a session. And don't hurt people like you did.
3/10/23, 11:11 AM - Patrick Jane: Yes : )
3/11/23, 10:29 AM - Nivedha NV: So I guess it's right. You got your only friend very recently
3/11/23, 10:33 AM - Patrick Jane: The conversation I had with that person yesterday which u saw was of a colleague
3/11/23, 10:34 AM - Patrick Jane: Trust me, I know very well when people become distant n start seeing me only as a colleague.
3/11/23, 10:34 AM - Patrick Jane: It was never the same like before. It'll never be I guess
3/11/23, 10:35 AM - Patrick Jane: Another colleague only person who have added to me to their list
3/11/23, 11:13 AM - Nivedha NV: Stay there! When I was your friend, you didn't treat me like one. But nevertheless, I am sorry that you were lonely even at that time and playing foosball.
3/11/23, 11:13 AM - Nivedha NV: Well. She is your friend if you are willing to be. Doesn't matter what had happened
3/11/23, 11:15 AM - Patrick Jane: She's no longer willing. Guess like u wanted she's moved away, I won't be able to do anything to her. Another colleague avlo than. Santhoshama? world is a better place now
3/11/23, 11:15 AM - Patrick Jane: I treated you like my only friend. It's just that I couldn't get more of ur time that I started feeling lonely. We could have addressed this issue better, nevertheless. Back to being lonely
3/11/23, 11:16 AM - Patrick Jane: It's okay I'm used to it now. As always
3/11/23, 11:58 AM - Patrick Jane: Alone in the dark, I sit and write. The only sound I hear is the scratching of my pen against the paper. The darkness envelopes me, making me feel like the only person left in the world. But the words flow freely from my mind, taking shape on the page.

As I write, I feel my emotions pour out onto the paper. My fears, my hopes, my dreams – all of them are laid bare for anyone who cares to read. But in this moment, I am content to be alone in the darkness, with only my thoughts and my words for company.

The darkness doesn't scare me. Instead, it feels like a comforting blanket, shielding me from the outside world. In this darkness, I am free to be myself, to express myself without fear of judgment or ridicule.

And so, I continue to write, my words becoming bolder and more confident with each passing moment. The darkness may surround me, but I am not afraid. For in this darkness, I have found my voice.
3/13/23, 10:05 PM - Patrick Jane: Funny how I stopped everything and it feels lonely than ever before.  It hurts so much to look around and see ppl bond well with others n spend happy time together when I'm not
3/13/23, 10:07 PM - Patrick Jane: I also lost most of what I learned over the years, I can't even think of any of my skills now. Everything around me including myself is beginning to fall apart. I'm losing everything
3/13/23, 10:08 PM - Patrick Jane: Probably this might n may be my last msg fr yu. I wouldn't disturb you or anyone ever again. I'm happy yu have great ppl with you :')
3/13/23, 10:08 PM - Patrick Jane: Keep smiling as always
3/17/23, 1:17 AM - Nivedha NV: I did mind when you did something to her. But I never wanted her to be not friends with you. To be honest, I would have just been happy if she was your friend from the beginning.
3/17/23, 1:17 AM - Nivedha NV: I didn't mean to make you lonely. But one thing for sure is the way it could have been handled
3/17/23, 1:19 AM - Nivedha NV: Nerve-wrecking and sending chills through the spine.
3/17/23, 1:19 AM - Nivedha NV: I am sure you'll be alright.
3/17/23, 1:19 AM - Nivedha NV: You won't lose anything. Trust me. If anything, you'll just gain valuable friendships
3/17/23, 1:20 AM - Nivedha NV: You keep smiling as always Sathish.
3/18/23, 12:16 PM - Patrick Jane: 💯
3/20/23, 10:47 PM - Patrick Jane: Just a little worried da
3/20/23, 10:47 PM - Patrick Jane: Nikil was like I went thru the documents u sent, it was detailed and nothing seemed to be wrong from our end, but cx insisted they wanted another SE to take it forward
3/20/23, 10:47 PM - Patrick Jane: Nikil didn't even hesitate, he wanted me to say yes for looping in another SE
3/20/23, 10:47 PM - Patrick Jane: I'm getting this weird feeling he wouldn't hesitate to do much greater things to me, considering the rifts we were having recently :/
3/20/23, 10:48 PM - Nivedha NV: Ashwin's scenario is true

As you two walked beside,
I'll keep my feelings at bay,
And cherish our friendship each day.
3/28/23, 8:51 AM - Patrick Jane: I'm not sure 😂

Caught in a bind,
Mixed feelings entwined,
You want me to stay,
But also push me away.
3/28/23, 8:53 AM - Patrick Jane: Thank you so much for coming. 

An angel returned,
My darkness adjourned,
Hope and light restored,
My heart is adored.
3/28/23, 8:58 AM - Patrick Jane: Yessss

I bask in solitude's embrace,
A calm and peaceful space,
But I can't help but dream,
Of us together, a perfect team.

In the future, we'll reunite,
Sharing laughter and delight,
Until then, I'll cherish this peace

But just don't say that you hurt me once, you know it was very hurtful. Don't try to soften the intensity of that
5/13/23, 12:07 AM - Patrick Jane: I'm still trembling here thinking about today. You do affect me so much, because I let u to. I always wanted my friend to be my side. It just feel so bad and so hurting to see that I always have to beg for ur time n attention and others just get it so easily
5/13/23, 12:08 AM - Patrick Jane: This is what I've been going thru ever since may *2022

5/13/23, 12:13 AM - Nivedha NV: We should stop justifying wrong doings and just cherish the time that we have
5/13/23, 12:14 AM - Patrick Jane: I just so broke down, right now I'm just trembling for no reason. Adding to this, this is also making me go paranoid. Ppl get more of ur limited time and all I have is just time till 9:15pm

5/13/23, 12:15 AM - Nivedha NV: Karthik is important. There is zero denying that. He is one of my best friends and closest people. 

But even I don't spend time with him as much as you think. 

You don't have to go numb ellam. Adi vaanga pora
5/13/23, 12:16 AM - Patrick Jane: For once i wanted to be honest with you, speak it out, I just did. Sorry if I had done anything wrong. I'll not agree that me wanting ur time is not a wrong doing
5/13/23, 12:17 AM - Nivedha NV: I saw that. I don't want you to break down. I want you to be happy. Sorry maybe I didn't behave that way and I am fighting with you constantly. 
I'll change
5/13/23, 12:18 AM - Nivedha NV: I am glad you were honest.
5/13/23, 12:20 AM - Nivedha NV: Karthik is always going to be in my life. There is no denial in that. 

But as much as he is my friend, I want to be your confidante as well.

Take it in any way you want, I am telling the truth. It is what it is!
5/13/23, 12:22 AM - Nivedha NV: I don't know what you are thinking ma.

5/13/23, 7:48 AM - Patrick Jane: My love for you is pure n not tainted. Just understand that alone. That would explain why your chaotic frnd is doing /did all what he did n behaving like a high schooler
5/13/23, 7:49 AM - Patrick Jane: I'll try n call u, things r not really good at home since yesterday night. My anger turned towards mom yesterday night n it made things worse here.

5/13/23, 12:31 PM - Nivedha NV: Don't show the anger at home. One thing we know for a fact is to not focus our anger on someone else.

5/14/23, 11:27 PM - Patrick Jane: yes
5/14/23, 11:28 PM - Patrick Jane: whoever wrote that above cipher used number 16(your momz bday)  as the cipher key
5/14/23, 11:28 PM - Patrick Jane: I firmly believe that no one enters our lives without a reason and I have found the reason for your presence in my life. I have plans for you, big plans. It's only a matter of time before things fall into place. Now go for the last cipher. It holds a special message for you
5/14/23, 11:28 PM - Patrick Jane: Deciphered message
5/14/23, 11:29 PM - Nivedha NV: Let's go to the last message?
5/14/23, 11:29 PM - Patrick Jane: Do u have the last one?

5/14/23, 11:30 PM - Nivedha NV: This is so sweet, right? ♥️✨
5/14/23, 11:30 PM - Patrick Jane: Absolutely, very thoughtful message
5/14/23, 11:30 PM - Nivedha NV: But if it doesn't mean anything, the message would look differentla? We have to find another keyword
5/14/23, 11:31 PM - Nivedha NV: You are deciphering this?
5/14/23, 11:31 PM - Patrick Jane: I think someone as given this cipher for u to decode. I don't really think I should spoil the fun
5/14/23, 11:33 PM - Patrick Jane: I guess. But the key for the first cipher is 16, probably any other significance to the number 16, can u think of?
5/14/23, 11:35 PM - Nivedha NV: I don't know. Not personally
5/14/23, 11:35 PM - Nivedha NV: Atomic number of sulphur is 16?🙈
5/14/23, 11:36 PM - Patrick Jane: Haha probably yes if the person who sent u that likes chemistry then high possibility
5/14/23, 11:36 PM - Nivedha NV: I know.  Need to find it
5/14/23, 11:36 PM - Nivedha NV: Athelaam illa
5/14/23, 11:36 PM - Nivedha NV: I wanna know
5/14/23, 11:37 PM - Patrick Jane: Are u planning to find the key ?
5/14/23, 11:37 PM - Patrick Jane: Do u want me to try? It looks personal from the looks of it
5/14/23, 11:38 PM - Nivedha NV: Yes.
5/14/23, 11:38 PM - Nivedha NV: I think 16 is the key probably
5/14/23, 11:38 PM - Patrick Jane: For the last msg too?
5/14/23, 11:40 PM - Nivedha NV: Yes.
5/14/23, 11:40 PM - Patrick Jane: Great! Have u started decoding?
5/14/23, 11:43 PM - Nivedha NV: You try please. I am getting gibberish
5/14/23, 11:44 PM - Patrick Jane: I'll try da it looks a bit tough than the first one
5/14/23, 11:44 PM - Nivedha NV: Hmmm .. maybe this might help.
5/14/23, 11:45 PM - Patrick Jane: what da? are u sending something?
5/14/23, 11:46 PM - Patrick Jane: Little curious, why suddenly deciphering some messages in the middle of the night
5/14/23, 11:49 PM - Nivedha NV: I am cleansing stuff
5/14/23, 11:53 PM - Nivedha NV: Yeah.... Hey, need help with deciphering the text? Let me know. Sure. Let me do my best to make it easy. The message contains some important information. They might have encrypted it using the same code twice. Good luck decoding it.
5/14/23, 11:55 PM - Patrick Jane: Cleansing wat?? Ur cupboard?
5/14/23, 11:56 PM - Patrick Jane: Who sent this? U sent this to someone or someone sent it to you?
5/14/23, 11:56 PM - Patrick Jane: Pls give me context
5/14/23, 11:58 PM - Nivedha NV: Nope 😂
5/14/23, 11:58 PM - Patrick Jane: Sounds like 2
5/14/23, 11:58 PM - Patrick Jane: Ppl talking
5/14/23, 11:58 PM - Nivedha NV: Ennathu?
5/14/23, 11:58 PM - Nivedha NV: 😂
5/14/23, 11:59 PM - Patrick Jane: This sounds like two ppl talking. Give me context if u can
5/14/23, 11:59 PM - Patrick Jane: Then what? Chakras cleansing?
5/14/23, 11:59 PM - Nivedha NV: This is the first decoded message
5/14/23, 11:59 PM - Nivedha NV: 😏
5/15/23, 12:00 AM - Patrick Jane: Oh there was a first message also!!
5/15/23, 12:00 AM - Nivedha NV: ☘️🥷
5/15/23, 12:01 AM - Patrick Jane: Do u hVe the encoded msg?
5/15/23, 12:01 AM - Nivedha NV: 🤨
5/15/23, 12:01 AM - Patrick Jane: Looks like Ceasar cipher
5/15/23, 12:01 AM - Patrick Jane: Sorry at least they key value if u can tell me
5/15/23, 12:02 AM - Patrick Jane: I just want to see if there's any relevance between the 2nd and 1st

5/15/23, 12:06 AM - Patrick Jane: yu there?
5/15/23, 12:09 AM - Patrick Jane: i get a different message
5/15/23, 12:09 AM - Patrick Jane: not the same as this
5/15/23, 12:50 AM - Nivedha NV: What you got?
5/15/23, 12:50 AM - Nivedha NV: I was cleaning
5/15/23, 1:32 AM - Nivedha NV: Thoongittiyaaa

5/15/23, 9:31 PM - Patrick Jane: Give me the right key
5/15/23, 9:31 PM - Patrick Jane: Decipher the message again, with the key u think Is right
5/15/23, 10:07 PM - Nivedha NV: Oiii
5/15/23, 10:10 PM - Nivedha NV: Maaa
5/15/23, 10:22 PM - Patrick Jane: Hii
5/15/23, 10:26 PM - Nivedha NV: Substitution is not yielding any results. Maybe I need your help here
5/15/23, 10:26 PM - Nivedha NV: I'll try Tomorrow
5/15/23, 10:26 PM - Patrick Jane: No problem it's better not to do it
5/15/23, 10:26 PM - Nivedha NV: Thank you for everything today✨
5/15/23, 10:26 PM - Patrick Jane: Tell me
5/15/23, 10:27 PM - Patrick Jane: Wat did I do today?
5/15/23, 10:27 PM - Nivedha NV: Everything
5/15/23, 10:27 PM - Nivedha NV: I know you were holding a lot in your head, but you tried to act as normal as possible da kanna
5/15/23, 10:28 PM - Nivedha NV: You noticed the slightest change in me not feeling well and gave me things, you kept me distracted for the majority of the day.
5/15/23, 10:29 PM - Nivedha NV: We tend to take things for granted sometimes, but I felt like I should be grateful for these. 

I know you have always done these for me... But today you did even when you were feeling not so close to me
5/15/23, 10:29 PM - Nivedha NV: Thanksssss da ma
5/15/23, 10:30 PM - Patrick Jane: Y such big words I'll be there for you no matter if u r close to me or not
5/15/23, 10:30 PM - Patrick Jane: <Media omitted>
5/15/23, 10:31 PM - Patrick Jane: Is ur head still aching?
5/15/23, 10:31 PM - Nivedha NV: Soooooo much
5/15/23, 10:31 PM - Nivedha NV: Soooooo sooo much
5/15/23, 10:31 PM - Nivedha NV: Can't emphasize more
5/15/23, 10:31 PM - Nivedha NV: Nauseous
5/15/23, 10:32 PM - Patrick Jane: Take rest dont staring ur eyes too much it'll make ur headache worse and cause nausea
5/15/23, 10:32 PM - Nivedha NV: I don't know. This is distracting
5/15/23, 10:33 PM - Nivedha NV: Maybe... Maybe not. Grateful none theless
5/15/23, 10:33 PM - Nivedha NV: What's the black heart?
5/15/23, 10:33 PM - Nivedha NV: Evil?
5/15/23, 10:34 PM - Patrick Jane: <Media omitted>
5/15/23, 10:34 PM - Patrick Jane: u r the white
5/15/23, 10:34 PM - Patrick Jane: okay ill give u one more distraction
5/15/23, 10:34 PM - Nivedha NV: Ada poda 😂
5/15/23, 10:34 PM - Nivedha NV: Kodu kodu
5/15/23, 10:34 PM - Patrick Jane: so i think its not 10 the key
5/15/23, 10:34 PM - Nivedha NV: 🤍
5/15/23, 10:35 PM - Nivedha NV: It's not. Maybe 15 backwards?
5/15/23, 10:35 PM - Patrick Jane: exactly i think its 15
5/15/23, 10:35 PM - Nivedha NV: Forward or back?
5/15/23, 10:36 PM - Patrick Jane: the 2nd cipher u sent me had 16 as the key and it was 16 forward

so whoever this person is they wanted to take things forward i guess , intially i tried backwards it didnt work
5/15/23, 10:36 PM - Patrick Jane: so 15 forward gave me 👇
5/15/23, 10:36 PM - Patrick Jane: Oh, avlo periya arivali ah nee? You deciphered this. Good. This is just to test your skill. The actual message lies in the next two ciphers. Have fun decoding it.
5/15/23, 10:37 PM - Nivedha NV: 😂😂😂
5/15/23, 10:37 PM - Patrick Jane: im not sure how u got this message
5/15/23, 10:37 PM - Nivedha NV: Athellam oru vithaiyya vachu 😂
5/15/23, 10:37 PM - Patrick Jane: athu seri XD athan ketan ena key  nu
5/15/23, 10:37 PM - Patrick Jane: 15
5/15/23, 10:38 PM - Patrick Jane: seems no coinciedence
5/15/23, 10:38 PM - Patrick Jane: 15th is ur birthday correct ah
5/15/23, 10:38 PM - Patrick Jane: any other significance for the number 15?
5/15/23, 10:38 PM - Patrick Jane: is this is the first msg??
5/15/23, 10:42 PM - Nivedha NV: This I solved though. Ne arivaliyyannu check panen😶‍🌫
5/15/23, 10:43 PM - Nivedha NV: But yeah 😂, that is the first message
5/15/23, 10:43 PM - Patrick Jane: apo ithu summa neya amchiyaaa?
5/15/23, 10:43 PM - Patrick Jane: oh
5/15/23, 10:43 PM - Patrick Jane: then it makes more sense now
5/15/23, 10:44 PM - Patrick Jane: first msg is 15(ur bday)forward, next msg is 16(ur momz bday) forward
5/15/23, 10:44 PM - Patrick Jane: intresting
5/15/23, 10:44 PM - Patrick Jane: 3rd cipher also apo have u decoded???????
5/15/23, 10:46 PM - Patrick Jane: korangu, solritha i would have not wasted time on this msg,  adutha msg achum try panirpan
5/15/23, 10:49 PM - Nivedha NV: That was the easiest one 😂... I wanted you to understand something.
5/15/23, 10:49 PM - Nivedha NV: Neverthelesss
5/15/23, 10:50 PM - Patrick Jane: solu daa
5/15/23, 10:50 PM - Patrick Jane: today my level of understanding requirmes bit of fuel
5/15/23, 10:50 PM - Patrick Jane: u saw todayitself :XD
5/15/23, 10:53 PM - Patrick Jane: help me undertand  this "something"
5/15/23, 10:53 PM - Nivedha NV: Nope 😂
5/15/23, 10:54 PM - Nivedha NV: Nevertheless
5/15/23, 10:54 PM - Nivedha NV: Do you want to know what the third message reads?
5/15/23, 10:54 PM - Patrick Jane: :(
5/15/23, 10:54 PM - Patrick Jane: ok
5/15/23, 10:54 PM - Patrick Jane: of course
5/15/23, 10:54 PM - Patrick Jane: i mean
5/15/23, 10:54 PM - Patrick Jane: if its okay
5/15/23, 10:54 PM - Patrick Jane: i cant seem to decipher the last one
5/15/23, 10:55 PM - Nivedha NV: But I am confused. It doesn't make entire sense. Maybe I am using the wrong method
5/15/23, 10:55 PM - Patrick Jane: ena wrong method
5/15/23, 10:55 PM - Patrick Jane: ena cofused? give me context
5/15/23, 10:56 PM - Patrick Jane: waht entire sense? give that half sense , ill see if something means  out of the box
5/15/23, 10:56 PM - Patrick Jane: if its something personal u dont have to share
5/15/23, 10:57 PM - Nivedha NV: TheThe message has a deeper meaning. Something you wikl understand in time, as time shapes our lives. Until then, keep the message safe. I wikl come back one day and ask you to read the message again. The moment - the thought of fulfillment hits you, Ill be there... to witness it... and to hold the baby under the Godfather's wings.Now go find the hand writtgn mċssage hiddgn inside the switch box at your Workplace :)
5/15/23, 10:57 PM - Nivedha NV: You now get why I asked for the letter ?
5/15/23, 10:58 PM - Patrick Jane: Intersting : )
5/15/23, 10:58 PM - Patrick Jane: it took you one year to decode this?
5/15/23, 10:58 PM - Nivedha NV: It didn't
5/15/23, 10:59 PM - Nivedha NV: The day I asked you is when I decoded this
5/15/23, 10:59 PM - Patrick Jane: it was last thursday
5/15/23, 11:00 PM - Nivedha NV: Yup
5/15/23, 11:00 PM - Patrick Jane: 361 calender days
5/15/23, 11:00 PM - Patrick Jane: it took you
5/15/23, 11:00 PM - Nivedha NV: Not exactly.
5/15/23, 11:00 PM - Patrick Jane: little curious why now?
5/15/23, 11:00 PM - Nivedha NV: I didn't try it then at all
5/15/23, 11:00 PM - Nivedha NV: You know that though
5/15/23, 11:00 PM - Patrick Jane: yes i know
5/15/23, 11:01 PM - Patrick Jane: but why now is my question when u couldve just flushed it down ur memory, why did u decide to take it up now
5/15/23, 11:01 PM - Nivedha NV: Maybe you'll find it odd
5/15/23, 11:01 PM - Patrick Jane: nothing u do or say i wont find it odd
5/15/23, 11:01 PM - Patrick Jane: tell me
5/15/23, 11:02 PM - Nivedha NV: But I guessed there is going to be a sweet message encoded in that.
5/15/23, 11:02 PM - Nivedha NV: I wanted to read it ennaikaachum if we were about to go our separate paths.
5/15/23, 11:02 PM - Nivedha NV: Athu pona varsham
5/15/23, 11:03 PM - Nivedha NV: That's because I wanted it to make an impact when we were about to break up to make sure we are good.
5/15/23, 11:04 PM - Nivedha NV: A lot of people wrote a lot of sweet things for me last birthday. Nothing is in my memory. I know it was sweet mattum thaan.
5/15/23, 11:04 PM - Nivedha NV: If I had decoded then, I would have had fun, that's for sure! But it still would have been a nice message at that time.
5/15/23, 11:05 PM - Nivedha NV: Recently, I wanted to renew that friendship
5/15/23, 11:05 PM - Nivedha NV: So wanted to read
5/15/23, 11:05 PM - Patrick Jane: are we breaking up?
5/15/23, 11:06 PM - Patrick Jane: are we going on our own paths(eventually yes) but anytme soon?
5/15/23, 11:06 PM - Nivedha NV: I wanted to read it in the time when we are at a bad term to renew the friendship
5/15/23, 11:06 PM - Patrick Jane: thats really sweet of you Vedha
5/15/23, 11:06 PM - Nivedha NV: Maybe... Maybe not
5/15/23, 11:07 PM - Nivedha NV: We are not!
5/15/23, 11:07 PM - Patrick Jane: its really overhwhleming to see someone take measures to renew the friendship
5/15/23, 11:07 PM - Patrick Jane: instead of letting it go down the drain
5/15/23, 11:08 PM - Patrick Jane: i wanted to u ask you, what is the last msg oda key?
5/15/23, 11:08 PM - Nivedha NV: I let it go down the drain. Make no mistake 😂
5/15/23, 11:08 PM - Nivedha NV: Last time you pulled that stunt is when I wanted to return all of your gifts and end it
5/15/23, 11:09 PM - Patrick Jane: can we not talk about yucky stuff now?
5/15/23, 11:09 PM - Patrick Jane: ur head is already aching
5/15/23, 11:09 PM - Nivedha NV: Yeah. For sure
5/15/23, 11:09 PM - Patrick Jane: u wanted distracion not boulders on ur head

5/15/23, 11:11 PM - Nivedha NV: Succeeded half way though
5/15/23, 11:11 PM - Nivedha NV: 😂
5/15/23, 11:11 PM - Patrick Jane: i made sure to not decipher the last one
5/15/23, 11:12 PM - Patrick Jane: intha mari kutty kutty vishiam, enaku kudu
5/15/23, 11:12 PM - Nivedha NV: I know.. that's why I sent it. Athu kashtama irukkumnu ne urutta aarambichapaye
5/15/23, 11:12 PM - Patrick Jane: .
5/15/23, 11:13 PM - Nivedha NV: Nope 😂
5/15/23, 11:13 PM - Patrick Jane: .
5/15/23, 11:13 PM - Nivedha NV: <Media omitted>
5/15/23, 11:13 PM - Patrick Jane: what made u choose that key?
5/15/23, 11:13 PM - Patrick Jane: when u had lots of possiblites
5/15/23, 11:14 PM - Nivedha NV: <Media omitted>
5/15/23, 11:15 PM - Patrick Jane: stubborn person
5/15/23, 11:15 PM - Nivedha NV: You didn't know that?

5/15/23, 11:16 PM - Nivedha NV: But the worst part is... I thought the sweet message entirely is in this!!!
5/15/23, 11:16 PM - Nivedha NV: But you had a letter along with that!!!
5/15/23, 11:16 PM - Nivedha NV: That's a nice one
5/15/23, 11:17 PM - Patrick Jane: yes, because if u had finisehd teh ntoebook u would have ept it in the attic, which would make the msg get lost among the dusts
5/15/23, 11:17 PM - Patrick Jane: so thats why moved the msg to a letter
5/15/23, 11:18 PM - Nivedha NV: If you had known me, I would never write in it unless I feel it's something extremely important worth noting in a gift!!!
5/15/23, 11:18 PM - Nivedha NV: That's cute and unexpected 😂
5/15/23, 11:19 PM - Patrick Jane: im with u , so i expected u to write a lot of things in that notebook 😂

5/15/23, 11:31 PM - Nivedha NV: Honest
5/15/23, 11:32 PM - Nivedha NV: Always
5/15/23, 11:32 PM - Nivedha NV: Why is that a question?
5/15/23, 11:34 PM - Patrick Jane: we are not honest with each other like friends?

5/15/23, 11:34 PM - Patrick Jane: probably we are not comforatable enuf(not with each other) (but comfortable enuf to open up about few things)

5/15/23, 11:37 PM - Nivedha NV: Sometimes I lie and sometimes you do too. 

I used to trust you so much before. 
But for some reason the truth that you say as well sounds deceitful.
5/15/23, 11:37 PM - Nivedha NV: I want this to change... Maybe it will eventually....
5/15/23, 11:37 PM - Nivedha NV: Time is everything

5/15/23, 11:44 PM - Nivedha NV: Those were the times when I was very happy in the office. I was confident that I have people who will have my back no matter what
5/15/23, 11:44 PM - Patrick Jane: u still have ppl who have ur back
5/15/23, 11:45 PM - Nivedha NV: You were one of my closest people at that time ... You remember?

5/16/23, 12:05 AM - Patrick Jane: Like giving more importance to others, (let's not get into this topic) (this is sorted)

5/16/23, 12:13 AM - Nivedha NV: 😂
5/16/23, 12:14 AM - Patrick Jane: Other days, I would run against the wind

in an attempt to ward off my grief.

And the dismal sky mirrored my torment,

but it offered no comfort or reprieve.

For it knew never to close its distance,

I was a human, too fatal a friend.
5/16/23, 12:15 AM - Nivedha NV: Oh, how I wish this moment could last,
But alas, time moves on so fast,
And soon the sun will rise anew,
Bringing an end to this dream so true.
5/16/23, 12:18 AM - Patrick Jane: of the people who once believed in me.

My apologies are empty silences because

my words disappear into my oesophagus

like it is a drain pipe leading to the sea bed

and I can never explain why I said what I said;
those are quiet days, and my words sink

to the bottom of the Pacific in their shame.

I wander, hoping the night would stay still. As this is a beautiful dream that I don't want to wake up from
5/16/23, 12:19 AM - Nivedha NV: Is this one poem?
5/16/23, 12:19 AM - Patrick Jane: Yes
5/16/23, 12:19 AM - Patrick Jane: Doesn't it look like it?

5/16/23, 12:24 AM - Patrick Jane: Ipothiki nee than enoda audience. Unkita na downplay pana matan
5/16/23, 12:26 AM - Nivedha NV: I try to hold them in, these feelings so deep,
But they spill out like tears, a flood I cannot keep,

For those who might listen, who might lend an ear,
And help me to ease this burden of life,
But the words won't come, they're trapped within,
And I'm left with this storm, this tempest within.
5/16/23, 12:26 AM - Nivedha NV: Vaippu irukku 😂
5/16/23, 12:27 AM - Nivedha NV: I hope someday, I'll find the key,
To break the chains and set words free,
To speak my truth, to find my way,
And live a life that's bright as day.
5/16/23, 12:27 AM - Patrick Jane: So deep, yu wrote this now??

5/17/23, 12:10 AM - Nivedha NV: 🧞‍♀️
5/17/23, 12:12 AM - Patrick Jane: Becoming progressively abusive with each passing day at ur own son, saying unhealthy abusive words at ur son every min from i come home till I leave next day n not expect me to react. It's...
5/17/23, 12:14 AM - Patrick Jane: U a genie? Can you grant wishes..
5/17/23, 12:16 AM - Patrick Jane: This is definitely not the way to express ur loneliness. It will definitely have effects in how I react with my near n dear ones..

5/17/23, 10:43 PM - Patrick Jane: My fav Pic
5/17/23, 10:47 PM - Patrick Jane: Wish 1

Whispers of Tomorrow: "My first wish would be for a book with blank pages that mysteriously fill with sketches of the moments we are yet to live. Not to know our fate, but to savor the thrill of seeing life's doodles turn into shared memories."
5/17/23, 10:48 PM - Patrick Jane: Wish 2

Invisible Threads: "My second wish would be for an unseen thread connecting our hearts, allowing us to share our feelings in silence. When laughter bubbles up within me, I'd want it to tickle your heart too. If sorrow ever dampens my spirit, your heart would subtly echo that sigh. Not to blur our individuality, but to color our bond with shades of shared emotions."
5/17/23, 10:48 PM - Patrick Jane: Wish 3

Unending Symphony: "My final wish would be for our love to be a melody, its notes held in the soft hues of an eternal sunset. An unending symphony, always beautiful, always ours. It's not about freezing time, but about appreciating our love as an ongoing melody that's as captivating and enduring as a picture-perfect sunset."
5/17/23, 10:48 PM - Patrick Jane: 🧞‍♀️
5/17/23, 11:39 PM - Patrick Jane: Genie lamp kula poidchu pola.. Gn tc sleep well

5/18/23, 12:09 AM - Nivedha NV: I really wish the same as well. If God wills, our friendship should be timeless even after the thicks and thins

5/18/23, 11:08 PM - Patrick Jane: We could have literally talked about pretty much anything.. Astronomy, life, multi verse...but instead we spoke about a random creep..
5/18/23, 11:08 PM - Patrick Jane: Even now after his absence he stole my time with u
5/18/23, 11:09 PM - Patrick Jane: I'm quite anxious though... If we will ever get such time again with no distractions.... Just uuu n meee

5/18/23, 11:59 PM - Patrick Jane: What do u infer from this 👇
5/18/23, 11:59 PM - Patrick Jane: True intimacy requires your vulnerability, your complete authenticity. No disguises, no facades, no pretense. You may spend a lifetime in someone's company, share moments of physical closeness, and relish trivial delights and surface-level interactions, but these barely scratch the surface. To truly engage with another on a profound level, it is essential that you bare your heart and soul, your brilliance and shadow, your triumphs and regrets, unafraid of being judged. Even if the other person assesses and withdraws, you will never feel alone. Your solitude carries a distinct aroma, a beauty that is unique to your genuine self.
5/18/23, 11:59 PM - Patrick Jane: Ama iru.. Tablet saptiya ilaya? U shld be dread sleeping now la

I don't think we were talking at that time when all these were happening.

I was thinking about how good times were between us one day when I looked at you. 

And then I saw you talking with pradha the exact way you did with me.

I cried so badly that day thinking all these while a friendship that I thought I had was just a manipulation done by someone and basically an illusion.
5/19/23, 12:27 AM - Nivedha NV: I went back home, my confidante mom called me...  I cried her telling 
" mom, I don't think anybody is permanent in my life and it's only you, cause people betray you all the time"

5/20/23, 1:14 AM - Patrick Jane: I believe the God he worships the actual Amman not the godman
5/20/23, 1:14 AM - Patrick Jane: But mom's been following him since her teenage
5/20/23, 1:14 AM - Patrick Jane: So her roots are sealed
5/20/23, 1:14 AM - Patrick Jane: Every room in my home has his photo 10 plus pics
5/20/23, 1:15 AM - Patrick Jane: Sami stand laye 5 photos

5/20/23, 1:16 AM - Nivedha NV: That doesn't seem right
5/20/23, 1:17 AM - Patrick Jane: Apparently.. Coincidentally in my 10th many of my frnds flunked in math's n I passed 🙃and she credits the guru for it
5/20/23, 1:17 AM - Patrick Jane: I used to flunk all the math exam at school

5/20/23, 1:19 AM - Nivedha NV: I don't know the back story  for these though

5/20/23, 1:23 AM - Nivedha NV: Indi is the aunt who is in this conversation?
5/20/23, 1:23 AM - Patrick Jane: Both his parents are professors, cheenu a math God, his wife a physics freak.. They expected him to score more than 80%but he got 75%
5/20/23, 1:24 AM - Patrick Jane: They expected the result at 2pm today but they released it earlier
5/20/23, 1:24 AM - Patrick Jane: They got scared he might do something to him
5/20/23, 1:24 AM - Patrick Jane: Because he didn't fulfill his parents wish
5/20/23, 1:24 AM - Patrick Jane: True 👌🏻✨

5/20/23, 1:25 AM - Nivedha NV: That is sad!. 80 percent does not equate to being a math god 😂
5/20/23, 1:25 AM - Nivedha NV: But alright
5/20/23, 1:25 AM - Patrick Jane: My uncle is a math God
5/20/23, 1:25 AM - Nivedha NV: Oh. Gotchaaa
5/20/23, 1:26 AM - Patrick Jane: <Media omitted>

5/20/23, 1:34 AM - Patrick Jane: Yes da maa
5/20/23, 1:35 AM - Nivedha NV: Not every child is born to study. All you need to understand is what that child wants to do.
5/20/23, 1:35 AM - Patrick Jane: True that
5/20/23, 1:35 AM - Nivedha NV: That's good. Basically after tomorrow, anything that you did will fetch you the best results. ✨♥️

5/20/23, 1:38 AM - Nivedha NV: One thing for sure that I understand is your mom has a really morphed picture of reality.

She thinks all of the outside is drugs, alcohol and prostitution.
5/20/23, 1:38 AM - Patrick Jane: Can't wait for it to happen ✨ 🐕‍🦺🥳

5/20/23, 1:39 AM - Patrick Jane: It's always worth it if the friend is a special kind of friend and not a normal frnd
5/20/23, 1:40 AM - Nivedha NV: I don't think I understand. I am sure your mom has a lot of layers to her.

She is a good person internally trying to give the best life for her kids in the ways that she thinks is the best.
5/20/23, 1:41 AM - Patrick Jane: This is so true..
5/20/23, 1:41 AM - Nivedha NV: But our parents best might not be the best for us. I don't think she understands that
5/20/23, 1:42 AM - Patrick Jane: True.. Her morphed reality is making her take decisions that doesn't go well with reality
5/20/23, 1:42 AM - Nivedha NV: Paavam she is and you too!

I hope she understands that her son is a grown person capable of making their own decisions.

5/20/23, 1:46 AM - Patrick Jane: Unless my magical partner can make my mom understand
5/20/23, 1:46 AM - Nivedha NV: She sounds like a woman who likes to stay in control.
Just because she feels like you are the only thing in the world she can have a control over.
5/20/23, 1:46 AM - Patrick Jane: 🥺🥺🥺🥺Soooo trueeeee
5/20/23, 1:47 AM - Nivedha NV: I hear you. That is true
5/20/23, 1:48 AM - Nivedha NV: Well... I don't think you should put it on your partner.

As much as I think that your partner can help... It's on you to make sure that duty is not on your partner
5/20/23, 1:48 AM - Nivedha NV: In all the scenarios you are dominant as a person as far as I know you. 
With your mom you are pretty submissive. 

You might have to break your own vicious cycle.
5/20/23, 1:49 AM - Patrick Jane: <Media omitted>
5/20/23, 1:49 AM - Nivedha NV: It's going to be tough for sure. There is no doubt about that. But if you can't do it, then who can?
5/20/23, 1:49 AM - Nivedha NV: Yesssssssss✨
5/20/23, 1:50 AM - Patrick Jane: Exactly because I'm submissive at home I tend go all dominant outside of my home 😐
5/20/23, 1:50 AM - Patrick Jane: Trueeeee
5/20/23, 1:51 AM - Nivedha NV: I understand da ma.

5/20/23, 1:52 AM - Nivedha NV: That is sweet kannu. 
But I always had invites for you.
It's just that you were never in a position to come out.
5/20/23, 1:52 AM - Patrick Jane: <Media omitted>
5/20/23, 1:52 AM - Nivedha NV: Here is the thing, even if my family stayed in chennai, I wouldn't have come out
5/20/23, 1:53 AM - Patrick Jane: I can agree on that
5/20/23, 1:53 AM - Nivedha NV: Or had the freedom that I have currently. Maybe a little bit but not a bit more.

5/20/23, 1:54 AM - Nivedha NV: I know right

5/20/23, 1:55 AM - Nivedha NV: Thank God for that. 
But there are a lot of things I need to do.
5/20/23, 1:56 AM - Nivedha NV: I won't ever let this sway me.
5/20/23, 1:56 AM - Patrick Jane: You won't let that
5/20/23, 1:56 AM - Nivedha NV: As much as my mom is tough, she is also a sweet heart. 
My whole life is to make her happy. That is my purpose.
5/20/23, 1:56 AM - Patrick Jane: You will do the things that you are bound to do 🔥 I trust you
5/20/23, 1:56 AM - Nivedha NV: I won't.

5/20/23, 2:00 AM - Nivedha NV: Understandable... But there are a lot of people whom you are yet to meet.
